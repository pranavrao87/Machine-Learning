# Neural Network Regression with TensorFlow
Overview
This README provides an introduction to neural network regression, with a specific focus on linear regression, and its implementation using the TensorFlow library. It explains the concept of regression, outlines the neural network approach, demonstrates how to use TensorFlow to build and train a linear regression model, and includes a section on normalizing data.

# What is Regression?
Regression is a machine learning technique used for predicting continuous numerical values based on input data. It aims to find the relationship between input variables (features) and the corresponding output variable (target) by fitting a mathematical model to the data. Regression models provide a continuous mapping between the inputs and outputs, enabling predictions for unseen data points.

# Neural Network Regression
Neural network regression is a variant of regression that utilizes neural networks as the underlying model. Neural networks consist of interconnected layers of artificial neurons, which learn to extract complex patterns and relationships from the input data.

In linear regression, a neural network with a single output neuron is used to predict a continuous output value. The network takes input features, applies weights and biases to them, and produces a predicted value through a linear combination of the inputs. The training process involves adjusting the weights and biases to minimize the difference between the predicted values and the actual target values.

# Normalizing Data
Normalizing data is a common preprocessing step in regression tasks, including neural network regression. Normalization ensures that all input features are on a similar scale, which helps the neural network converge faster and makes the training process more stable.

There are various methods for normalizing data, such as min-max scaling and z-score normalization. Min-max scaling transforms the data to a specific range, often between 0 and 1, while z-score normalization standardizes the data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.

In TensorFlow, data normalization can be performed using the library's built-in functions or manually implemented. The choice of normalization technique depends on the nature of the data and the requirements of the regression problem.

# TensorFlow for Neural Network Regression
TensorFlow is a popular open-source machine learning library that provides extensive support for building and training neural networks. It offers a flexible and efficient framework for implementing regression models, including linear regression.

To build a linear regression model using TensorFlow, the following steps can be followed:

1. Import the necessary TensorFlow modules and prepare the input features and target data.
2. Normalize the input features using an appropriate normalization technique.
3. Define the model architecture by creating placeholders for the input features and target values.
4. Initialize the model parameters (weights and biases) using TensorFlow variables.
5. Define the mathematical operations that compute the predicted values based on the input features.
6. Define a loss function that measures the discrepancy between the predicted values and the actual targets.
7. Define an optimizer to minimize the loss function and update the model parameters.
8. Train the model by repeatedly feeding the normalized training data, running the optimizer, and adjusting the parameters.
9. Evaluate the trained model's performance on unseen data by making predictions and comparing them to the actual values.

# Models
There are two simple linear regression models in this folder. 
- The first is a Medical Insurance model which predicts the cost of a person's insurance based on a few inputs.
- The second is a Californian housing price model which predicts the median house price in california based on its location and other deciding factors

# Conclusion
Neural network regression, specifically linear regression, is a powerful technique for predicting continuous numerical values. By leveraging TensorFlow, building and training linear regression models becomes more accessible and efficient. TensorFlow's extensive capabilities, along with data normalization techniques, make it a valuable tool for implementing and experimenting with various regression models in the field of machine learning.
