## This folder is dedicated to tensors and exploring different functions in TensorFlow

Tensors are a fundamental part in understanding machine learning so I figured this was a good place to start my learning. Tensors are used in representing data in numbers in 
order for machine learning algorithms and nueral networks to observe patterns. These patterns are then used to modify input tensors into output tensors such that this output
tensor can be converted into readable data.
